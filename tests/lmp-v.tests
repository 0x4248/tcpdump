# The "verbose" Link Management Protocol test involves a float calculation that
# may produce a slightly different result depending on the compiler and the
# version of the instruction set for which it's generating code (see GitHub
# issue #333). The test is done only if we have a floating-point type, as
# reported by "./tcpdump --fp-type", of FPTYPE1.
